# Block Legacy Authentication Using Conditional Access (LAB)

## Overview

In this lab, I configured a Conditional Access policy in Microsoft Entra ID to block legacy authentication methods. Legacy authentication does not support modern security controls such as MFA, making it a common attack vector for credential-based attacks like password spray and brute force attempts.

This policy helps strengthen an organization’s security posture by ensuring all sign-ins use modern authentication protocols that support MFA and Conditional Access enforcement.


## Skills Demonstrated

* Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
* Conditional Access policy configuration
* Legacy authentication risk mitigation
* Identity and access management (IAM)
* Security posture hardening
* Zero Trust principles





- Created a Conditional Access policy (“CA-Require-Block Legacy Auth”) to explicitly target and block legacy authentication sign-ins.

- Configured user scope by including all users while excluding specific accounts (such as break-glass or emergency accounts) to prevent administrative lockout during enforcement.

- Set target resources to “All cloud apps”, ensuring legacy authentication is blocked across the entire tenant rather than limited to a single application.

- Configured client app conditions to specifically include legacy authentication clients (such as Exchange ActiveSync and other legacy protocols), targeting only non-modern sign-in methods.

- Applied access controls to block access when legacy authentication is detected and enabled the policy, enforcing modern authentication and reducing exposure to credential-based attacks.

## Conclusion

This configuration was necessary to remove legacy authentication, which cannot enforce MFA and is frequently exploited in credential-based attacks. By blocking legacy sign-ins with Conditional Access, the organization reduces its attack surface and strengthens its overall identity security posture.
