## **Require Password Reset for High-Risk Users Using Conditional Access**


**Screenshot 1 – Conditional Access Policy Creation (User Risk-Based Password Reset)**

This screenshot shows the creation of a Conditional Access policy named CA-UserRisk-RequirePasswordReset. The policy is designed to respond to elevated user risk, which Microsoft identifies when an account is likely compromised. The policy is scoped broadly to ensure protection across the tenant while remaining configurable through exclusions.

**Screenshot 2 – Target Resources Set to All Resources**

In this screenshot, the policy is configured to apply to All resources (formerly “All cloud apps”). This is required because the Require password change control can only be enforced when all resources are targeted. Applying the policy tenant-wide ensures that a compromised user cannot bypass remediation by accessing a different application.

**Screenshot 3 – User Scope and Exclusions (Break-Glass Protection)**

This screenshot shows All users included, with specific exclusions configured. The break-glass administrator account and a test user are excluded to prevent administrative lockout and allow safe testing. This reflects real-world operational best practices when deploying high-impact Conditional Access policies.

**Screenshot 4 – Grant Controls Configuration (Password Change Enforcement)**

Here, the Grant control is configured with Require password change. This control forces users identified as high risk to reset their password before regaining access. Microsoft Entra automatically lowers the user risk level once the password reset is completed, allowing access to resume securely.

**Screenshot 5 – Policy Enabled in Report-Only Mode**

This screenshot shows the policy enabled in Report-only mode. Report-only mode allows administrators to validate how the policy would behave in production without impacting users. This step is critical for verifying detections, minimizing false positives, and safely transitioning the policy to enforcement.

## **Conclusion**

----
This Conditional Access policy is necessary to protect against account takeover scenarios where user credentials are suspected to be compromised. By automatically requiring a password reset when high user risk is detected, the organization can rapidly contain threats without relying on manual intervention. This approach reduces attacker dwell time, prevents lateral movement, and aligns with Zero Trust principles by continuously validating identity trust. Implementing this policy demonstrates a proactive, automated identity security control commonly used in enterprise environments.
